                This cloud toolkit is an attempt to democratize the development and experimentation of microtasking
                projects to anyone
                having some basic
                knowledge about html/javascript. It is based on two main principles.
                <ul>
                    <li><h3>Zero server</h3>

                        <p>We live in the age of cloud computing so no need to set up your own server and a database.
                            Our goal is also *not* to host projects. Actually we are like a search engine
                            maintaining an index of tasks for volunteers. We index your tasks via <a
                                    href="http://www.google.com/fusiontables/public/tour/index.html">a google fusion
                                table</a> (input). We manage the allocation of tasks and send the results
                            to another fusion table (output) we generated but on which you have the ownership.

                        <p>
                            You are only in charge of the user interface to
                            collect
                            the data via a HTML/javascript template. Some helpers/libraries are available. From this
                            script, we generate a web widget <!-- (and the output fusion table)--> you can embed to your web page
                            or share like a youtube video (or used it as banner on your partners' web sites instead of advertising).</p>
                        </p></li>

                    <li>

                        <h3>Openess: toward a micro-tasking ecosystem</h3>

                        <p>
                            We think that what is valuable is not only the data but also the mechanism you used to
                            collect them.
                            So if you
                            generate a
                            project via this platform your html/script template will be automatically shared with the
                            community
                            so other
                            people can transform or combine it. We think such openess will facilitate the emergence of
                            best practices in micro tasking, and leverage more quickly a potential community.
