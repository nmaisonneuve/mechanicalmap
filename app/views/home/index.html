                This small project is an attempt to democratize the development of microtasking projects to anyone
                having some basic
                knowledge about html/javascript. This cloud toolkit enables quick experimentations and is based on two
                main principles.
                <ul>
                    <li><h3>Zero server</h3>

                        <p>No need to set up your own server and a database. we index your tasks via a google fusion
                            table (input). We
                            generate a web widget you can embed to your web page and your friends' ones like a youtube
                            video (or put it as a
                            banner instead of advertising). We also manage the allocation of tasks and send the results
                            to a google fusion table (output). You are only in charge of the user interface to collect
                            the data via a HTML/javascript template.
                            (some helpers/libraries are available to help you, see also the next section), and recruit
                            volunteers (future features will help you in this direction).

                        <h3>Openess: toward a micro-tasking ecosystem</h3>

                        <p>
                            We think that what is valuable is not only the data but also the mechanism you used to
                            collect them.
                            So if you
                            generate a
                            project via this platform your html/script template will be automatically shared with the
                            community
                            so other
                            people can transform or combine it. We think such openess will facilitate the emergence of
                            best practices in micro tasking, and leverage more quickly a potential community.
